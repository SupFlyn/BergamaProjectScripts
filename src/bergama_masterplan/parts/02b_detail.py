# ================================================================ v21: the 1:1,000 detail sheet and the booklet crops
# Aras 25 Oct 21:49 on the booklet's 1:1,000 page: "this should add more detail from what we have shown in
# masterplan". The detail sheet shows the two windows of the booklet's C3 page (upstream entry; K5 with Demeter's
# Garden) at 1:1,000 with what the whole plan cannot show, all from the project's data:
#   cuts      at the water board's surveyed channel cuts (the proposal sections stand on them) the bed level and
#             the DSI Q100 / Q500 levels with the width each covers there (CUT_AT); v25: no cut or section lines
#   route     the zone base's water links numbered in the order of the water route (ROUTE), with the areas the
#             script computes from the zone curves (no script computes a storage volume: left out, logged)
#   planting  band letters and species codes of the booklet's verified list (plan page C7 = water board v1.9
#             PLANT_BANDS / SPECIES) on the zones whose wetness tier they belong to (ZONE_PLANTING)
#   levels    survey spot heights (NOKTA_TAKEOMETRI) in the bed and on the bank tops, by the edges river_walks found
#   sketches  (Aras 21:57) terrace steps as a few strokes in the retention terraces and flood terraces, ramps as
#             wedges on the zone base's people-to-the-water links: zones and sketch marks, abstract, no dimensions
# Booklet (CROP_SPEC.md, Aras 21:47): the booklet's drawings are crops of the sheets; blocks.json holds one crop per
# panel (both halves of the masterplan sheet, both detail windows), results.json the frames and places.
# v27 (MIRAQUA 28 Oct, P24.1-P24.5, F11): the windows are drawn by r28_window_panel (parts/02e_r28_detail.py) in the
# fade-out programme language; of the list above they keep the cuts' bed and flood levels (no bands across the
# stream) and the water route with its areas and rough volumes. The planting codes, band letters, survey spot
# heights and sketches are gone (their tables with them).
