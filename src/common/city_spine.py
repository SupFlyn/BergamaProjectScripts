# city_spine.py (1 Nov 2026, Aras 07:48: "move that part of the city link code into the masterplans script"): the
# streamside spine, its bank vote and its stops, shared by bergama_city_link and bergama_masterplan, so the masterplan
# builds the spine itself (spine_spec) and no longer needs city_link_results.json; city link then runs once, after it.
# Needs bridge_name (common/names.py) and bg_cache (common/bergama_paths.py) included before it.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ the spine and the function sites (survey m)
# Anchors are surveyed points (h01 §0 and §5, source s62): K4 Ulucami Önü (29846,32278), K3 Tabak Köprüsü (30037,32122),

# side="auto": the bank is picked by the data (Aras 24 Oct 09:08: where more people live and modern buildings
# concentrate). Per bank, within catch_m of the stream along the piece: people = floors of homes (a proxy; footprints
# not weighted), modern = buildings of 3+ floors. More of both wins; on a split, modern decides when people differ by
# under 10 %, else people. The site board v34 recomputes it live from its buildings (survey floors + inferred) and
# writes the vote to city_link_movement.json, which wins over the built-in vote below.
# Built-in vote: survey floor labels YAZI_KAT_ADEDI (2,894 labels, course DXF of 17 Oct), the same floors as the board's
# density drawings; stream = OSM Selinos line; chainage and bank on the K4-K3-K5 chord (calculated, about ±30 m).
