# ---- G4 (MIRAQUA round 28 Oct 2026): labels never overlap each other, symbols or important linework ----------------
# Geometry only (page mm, any y direction): the caller measures its text and draws. Order of tries for each label:
# the spots round its point, then farther out on a thin leader (the leader may not cross a placed label), then the
# same at the smaller sizes in `sizes`; a label still without a spot is dropped if its rank allows it (secondary
# labels), else it gets the nearest free spot anywhere in bounds, on a leader. Boxes are (x0, y0, x1, y1).
