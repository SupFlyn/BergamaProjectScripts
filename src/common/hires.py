# ---- high-res silhouettes (assets_2, Aras 30 Oct 2026): PhyloPic trees, crops and animals as filled vector rings,
# drawn only in the detailed (true-to-cut) sections and recoloured there with that section's own colours. The
# sketchy sections and diagrams keep their own drawing (an abstract set comes later).
# Library: Downloads/Bergama/Data/assets_hires.json (run kit Data/), built in the cloud by
# tools/assets2/build_hires.py from revision_2026-10-29/assets_2_2026-10/ (roots cut at the ground, height 1.0,
# ground / feet at y = 0, y up). Each part = one keyhole ring for the even-odd fill + its outer and hole rings for
# outlines. Uniform scale only (never stretched). No JSON on the PC -> callers fall back to their own drawing.
# The sources are listed once on the booklet's Sources page under ASSETS (Aras 30 Oct 06:20), never beside a drawing.
