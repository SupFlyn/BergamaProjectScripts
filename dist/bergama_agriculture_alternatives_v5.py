#   content lives on the water board's p17 and p14-15); pictograms and step markers from common/icons.py (02 §2); D13:
#   sources naming our own model run or method and status words never reach the printed key (cite).
# Storage, water to the farms and the farm areas are read on every run from the water balance script's output

VERSION = "v5"
# v4 (MIRAQUA 28 Oct, booklet revision v4, pages 18-19; a feature change, so the next whole number):
#   * P18.1 / P19.3 / P19.4 / G11 / G12: every photo through common/plant_photos.py; corn printed as "Corn (Mısır)"
#     (data key "maize" and the Wikimedia file kept); an empty frame says "no photo: <reason>".
#   * P19.1 / G5 / F10: the kicker top left; page 3's top-right corner on the booklet grid (column 8, 4 rows 5.2 mm
#     apart, 7.5 pt): steps 1-5, NEXT -> D The heritage loop (title bold), the chain key; no big page numbers.
#   * P19.2: the ladder's people from common/figures.py at true scale (1.75 m), one colour, no stroke.
#   * G4 / F13: ladder labels placed by common/label_place.py clear of figures, lines, plants and each other;
#     "hub square: dry, step-free" and "wade the strip" now print.
#   * G13: flood heights in m with 2 decimals (values unchanged). Bank depth research 28 Oct §4.5: over the bank top
#     only at S4 (left); K4 before the DSİ walls.
#   * F5: [n] marks only for public online sources; internal pointers out of the printed source list.
#   * G1: page 2's group line removed; page 1's left column on the 14 mm margin.
# v3.1 (bugfix, Aras 27 Oct, booklet Prompt 8 "final check of every page"): plant and crop names "English (Turkish)"
#   from the shared table where pages 1 and 3 still had the English alone: page 3's season row OLIVE (ZEYTİN) HARVEST,
#   its labels (hub square: oriental plane (Doğu çınarı) shade; common reed (Kamış) gold; olive (Zeytin) harvest;
#   olive (Zeytin) trees on the fields) and page 1's "what it replaces" figure. Page 3: "stored winter water" and
#   "site edge: farmland outside" sit at the row's top edge, so they found no free place above it and were left out on
#   every run: they now go under their anchors. The h01 timeline quotes stay word for word. Page 1's "THE STREAM COMES
#   FIRST" block and the step chips: its 6.5 pt words are 7 pt, the smallest size on a booklet page.
# v3 (Aras 27 Oct 17:35, Prompt 6 "water, part 3"; the booklet's p.24-25):
#   * page 1, "THE STREAM COMES FIRST" between the headline and the bars (task 1: "show the defence ON the board"): the
#     priority 1 stream: summer strip -> 2 on-site planting -> 3 farms (the model has no draw of its own for the
#     planting: it lives on the strip's water, so it shares the strip's bar); the design store through a normal and the
#     1-in-5 dry water year as two stacked bars on one scale (strip, farms, left over; the store size dashed across
#     both), read live from the water balance v4 results (design.year_split, one daily run); and the double squeeze in
#     one line, computed: water left for the farms after the strip, the need per hectare and the hectares that water
#     serves, dry year against normal, then why deficit-irrigated olive is the lever. Without year_split (water balance
#     v3 or older) only the priority row is drawn (logged). The bars move down to make room: rows 16.5 mm apart (were
#     19.5), the reading box ends at the 14 mm margin.
#   * pages 1 and 3 say where they sit in the booklet: "C WATER · WHAT WE DO WITH IT" (was "AGRICULTURE ANALYSIS");
#     page 3, the last page of the water theme, closes it top right: what we do with the water in five steps and NEXT
#     D HISTORY AND HERITAGE (rule 7, task 3).
#   * m² and m³ are written as a raised small 2 or 3 (0.6 x the size, as wide as the glyph), which every PDF viewer
#     shows (task 2: "325,000-375,000 m" in some viewers).
# v2 (Aras 27 Oct, Prompt 5, rule 8: "Plant names: English first, Turkish in brackets, no Latin ... Every plant AND every
# crop in the booklet gets a photo of the plant itself ... openly licensed photos ... credited in the sources ... Same
# crop ratio and size for every photo"): every plant and crop name on pages 1 and 3 is "English (Turkish)" from the
# shared table (src/common/plant_photos.py), no Latin names on the pages. Page 3's step columns show each step's plants
# as photos (PHOTO_W x PHOTO_H mm, two side by side) with the name and the photo's [n] credit under each; the giant reed
# under REMOVE. Page 1 adds "THE CROPS" under the timeline: olive, cotton, corn, tomato as photos. The photos come
# from the shared cache Downloads/Bergama/cached/plant_photos/ (the water board shows the same photo of the same
# plant) and go into their frames with PyMuPDF after the PDF is written; a missing one is an empty frame saying "no
# photo", never an error; the log says how many were placed. Room on page 3: the chain sits 4 mm higher, the season rows
# are 50 mm (were 52; 4.5 mm stay above the tallest tree); the plants' reasons are left out under the photos when the
# column would not fit (logged). The Data file changes (STEPS: plant keys instead of botanical names): copy the new one.
# v1.7 (bugfix, Aras 27 Oct 16:05): page 3 crashed ("too many values to unpack": the sketch engine's items now
# carry a 4th value, the label group); the text under the component shows a newly pasted version at once, idle.
# v1.6 (Aras 27 Oct 11:07, booklet p24-26; revision_2026-10-27/PHASE2_SPEC.md): white pages (the beige paper goes); no
# source footers or credit lines on the pages: the [n] marks are numbered once for the sheet and their key is a 4th
# page "Sources" (the booklet's sources page reads it there). Page 1 adds "why the stored water goes to farms": a
# cotton / olive timeline in card h01's words and years, labels placed by measured width. Page 3 rebuilt for option A:
# the one-way chain upstream entry -> K4 -> K3 -> İstiklal -> K5 -> K6 -> downstream -> farmland outside the site,
# hubs and in-bed sub-hubs, programme and historic roots; the ladder drawn three times (high water, low water, olive
# harvest) with what people do on each step; the species under each step. Every label is placed by a collision check
# (Placer): a label with no free place is left out and named in the log.
# v1.5 (Aras 26 Oct 07:06, review of the deck, p.33-34): page 2's map is the site board's own plan 01 ("What is there",
# board v42+, cut from its sheet PDF with PyMuPDF and scaled by one factor, never redrawn) at the largest round scale
# that fits, with only the farms layer drawn on it (fields and orchards fed, their extent), the plan's own key, the
# figures beside it and a context line; v1.4's land cover drawing stays only as a flagged fallback. Page 3's ladder is
# drawn by the proposal sections' sketch engine (the p.23 upstream entry's language): hand ground, washes, winter
# water and summer strip, the faint design-flood reach, level marks, sketch plants and people, rain and sun marks.
# The "# r: pymupdf" line installs PyMuPDF in Rhino 8 on the first run (as the booklet).
# v1.4 (Aras 25 Oct 21:47-22:02, booklet stage 3): the booklet shows crops of this sheet (booklet/CROP_SPEC.md):
# blocks.json lists one crop per panel of the three pages and results.json keeps v1.3's keys; the v1.3 booklet redraws
# are gone. Caveat notes taken off the sheet (labels kept); "stream", never "river". Page 3's ladder drawn in the site
# board's section language (src/common/section_style.py): cut ground with sloped banks, the strip hatched, whole plants,
# one size across and up.
# v1.3 (25 Oct, booklet stage 2, SCRIPT_STANDARD §8): also writes output/<folder>/booklet/: c7_hero.pdf (plant ladder +
# the water board's planting bands A-F), c8_b.pdf (hectares per crop bars), blocks.json (every word a label) and
# results.json (hectares per crop). The A3 sheet is unchanged.
# v1.2 (Aras 25 Oct 17:00, SCRIPT_STANDARD §5b visual first): sentences become pictogram tiles, callouts and tags; method
# and source sentences become [n] marks with one numbered source key in each page's footer; layout and colours kept.
# Flood figures corrected to the surveyed sections (research/rain_river_levels/README.md, v1.1 correction and line 49).
# v1.1 (Aras 25 Oct 09:34-09:35): the same names in every script: the Button goes into an input named run, the log comes out of an output named log, and the log file is Downloads/Bergama/logs/bergama_agriculture_alternatives_log.txt (next to cached/ and output/), overwritten by each press.
# ---- Bergama folders (Aras 24 Oct 08:28 + 27 Oct 11:07; SCRIPT_STANDARD §9). Every script uses ONLY these. ----

# ("stiklal", "De irmen"). Now each font slot is Arial, embedded as a simple TrueType font with the SAME encoding
# (WinAnsi + the six Turkish letters in slots 129/141/143/144/157/158), so the strings, their measuring and the
# booklet's reading of the sheets stay as they were. Arial has Helvetica's widths, so nothing moves; text measured
# as Courier (the old monospace captions) comes out a little shorter. Text stays live for Illustrator.
# The font files are the system's (C:\Windows\Fonts\arial*.ttf, or the user's font folder): read and packed once per
# run. If a file is missing, that slot falls back to the old standard font and PDF_FONT_NOTE says so (for the log).
